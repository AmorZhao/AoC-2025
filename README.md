## random notes

So this is for AoC 2025.

This year I convinced my parents to do the challenges :>

So my mum will finally get a taste of writing a modern programming language (probably Python ...which lowkey isn't exciting :p but still getting her back into coding is a winnnn) In return I will pick up the language they used to write back in the 90s as a family throwback :D

Setting up was super easy:

In Msy2:

```
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran
```

Or Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install gfortran
```

Then any terminal:

```
gfortran -v
gfortran hello.f90 -o hello
./hello
```

And so, the adventure begins <333
